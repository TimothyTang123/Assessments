# Week 4 Assessment

Try your best to answer each question on your own before looking up the answer online. Once you're done writing your first answer, you can google the question and write the best answer you find.


#### 1. What is a method in Ruby? How is it different or similar to functions in JavaScript?
What is a method in Ruby? How is it different or similar to functions in JavaScript?
A method in Ruby is a function, and is no different than functions in JavaScript as they work the same in both languages.


#### 2. What does it mean that a class inherits from another class? Try to explain Ruby inheritance.


[Your Answer]: Similar to how JS classes work, Ruby classes inherits from their parent classes. Ruby has to use < symbol instead of the word extends, however they are both the same in terms of function. Ruby inheritance can be explained through an example.
If I have a class "Smith" which has the family name of Smith within it.
I could make another class called "Rick" and inherit the family name, but an attribute specific to Rick is to use his portal gun. Essentially a class inherits from the parent class. In Ruby if there is a method in the parent class it also gets inherited in the child class even though it isnt specificed within that class.

#### 3. What is rspec and what is the general process for writing tests in RSpec?

//Your Answer:
rspec is the testing tool used for Ruby. The process for rspec is BDD which is Behavior Driven Development in which the tests require you to describe the process or behavior of the method. Or in other words what the behavior of a function is rather than what the function does.

#### 4. Name three possible non-inheritance relationships between ruby objects?

//Your Answer: I honestly don't know and I can't find the answer off google. Apologies! Can you maybe go over this during the lecture?

#### 5. What do we call the #{} convention used below? What is it accomplishing?

```ruby
x = 1022
puts "I am printing a random number #{x}"
```
The convention we are using above is string interpolation and/or object literal. Essentially we can call that value within string interpolation without putting the integer within a string.

#### 6. How do you feel about testing right now? What potential pros/cons/barriers/advantages do you see to implementing BDD in your own code?

//Your Answer: Testing seemed very fun, as I had fun with it in JS as well. The barriers I found was syntax, and how it is different from JS. Ruby is easier but with different concepts it becomes foreign especially if we go at such a fast pace. I also really enjoy class inheritance in Ruby because it can inherit a lot easier from JS. The benefits of implementing BDD in your own code can be to see how code behaves rather than the function of it. You can test for what you want the code to do and how it behaves than rather how it operates.

#### 7. What is an instance variable in Ruby? How is it different from a normal, local variable?

//Your Answer:  An instance variable in Ruby is used when creating an instance of a class. It all has to do with scope. A local variable is only usable when defined within a method.

#### 8. Ruby has a great community and tons of free resources to help you learn. Here is the long list of great resources: https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/. Below are a few popular ones:
- Interactive Ruby tutorial (http://tryruby.org/levels/1/challenges/0)
- Why's (poigniant) Guide to Ruby: comics, anecdotes, and microscopic canaries (http://poignant.guide/book/chapter-1.html)
- Ruby in 20 min (https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/)


Choose one of these resources and go through the material (not for hours, only looking for around 10min of your time) then come back here and list a few new things you learned about Ruby.




Ruby language is actually gaining popularity amongest. programmers again recently which I thought is super exciting. According to the ranking list Ruby has been moved up to tenth place I believe. Most of the things I browsed on the web about Ruby I kinda knew already from what was explained in the lecture/class. I really enjoy how Ruby is so easy to write/read, and I especially like the get variables because that introduces user input to me for the first time.
