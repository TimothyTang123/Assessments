# Week 2 Assessment

### Without using Google answer the following:

1. What is the difference between .map() and .filter()?
They are both high order functions which means they can take in a function. Also they are both array methods, both very powerful tools. Map is a powerful method in which it can affect every value within the array and returning that array with the same number of values. Also map has a built in for loop within itself. Filter is used when you want to filter out certain data within an array and return an array with less values than the starting original . Filter is a powerful tool as it will always push the values you want and return that back to the original array.

2. Why would you use object destructuring?
Object destructuring is incredibly useful to write out lines of code. When given an object, you can destructure that object into one word making stronger code easy to accomplish. It allows us to access data within the object a lot easier by setting them equal to one variable. This was a huge plus in ES6 syntax.

3. What is the difference between var, let, and const?
Essentially they are the same in which you can use any of these to set variables. I am pretty sure const and let were introduced with ES6, which we all know is a positive upgrade in JavaScript code. The VAR variable when declared is within a global scope and be updated or redeclared. LET is a variable used within functions or locally scoped. The variables declared with let can be updated however cannot be redeclared within its scope. CONST is incredibly powerful as this variable cannot be redeclared and cannot be updated within its scope.

4. Why is testing important?
Testing is important to creating web apps and functions because you are bluepritining or planning what you want your function to do. Most importantly it helps guide you through exactly how you want your function or program to perform. Edge cases are especially helpful during this process because again it is planning ahead and knowing what you want your end product to be.

5. What is a higher order function?
A high order function is a function that takes in a function as an arugment or returns another function. Map and Filter are incredibly powerful and very useful as they have multiple functionalities within them. For example map has a for loop built in, and filter will push those values without having to create an empty array.

6. What is the difference between a class and an object?
The difference between a class and a object is hard as they kind of go hand in hand. But I believe a class is not a "real" thing more of a definition of many things. A class is like a blueprint for a house, but you still have to build the house. Classes define attributes and behaviors. An object is a collection of many smaller things. An example would be a car, which is an object made of many things.

7. What did you learn during the group project this week? Please include any additional feedback you may have.
The group project this week was extremely rough. React is a very powerful framework and I definitley want to learn it more, however I took a lot to grasp, and frankly not a lot of time which is the nature of a bootcamp. This week was hard as it was difficult to understand the concepts and put them towards the treasure hunt, however I will keep on studying little by little at home so hopefully I will become more familiar and comfortable with it in the future.

### HTML/CSS Review questions: First, try to answer each question on your own then Google the answer to further your knowledge.

1. How do you link a CSS file to your HTML page?
You can link a CSS file to an HTML page by using the <link> tag in the head of the HTML page, and inside the link define the file path using href.

2. What is the difference between a div and a span?
The difference between a div and a span is a div is used to house a larger chunk of code and a span is used as an inline element, where it usually holds one or two. A div is a block element meaning it basically has a line break when used.

3. What is a CSS class? When should you use an id instead of a class?
A CSS class selects elements with a specific class attribute. You write a CSS class by putting a period in front of it. An id should be used when you want to style a specific and single element. IDs are unique so it should only address one specific element. The CSS class should be used when you want to consistently style multiple elements.

4. Name 4 semantic HTML tags.
4 semantic HTML tags are :
<article>
<footer>
<form>
<nav>
<time>

5. What are three options for creating responsive design?
One option is to use the <meta> tag in HTML. <picture> and <width> are two more that are used for doing creative and responsive design.

### Stretch: The following questions are potential interview questions. First, try to answer each question on your own then Google the answer to further your knowledge.

1. What is front end development? Can you identify any tools/skills that are uniquely required of front end developers?
Front end development is also known as client side development. It is producing HTML, CSS and Javascript for web applications. They also are in charge of making sure the website is up and running on all browsers and to make sure there are no bugs when the product is finished. Some tools I think that are required for front end is React, React native? and open web platform?

2. What is block scope in JavaScript?
Block scope in JavaScript are used for if statements, for statements or within curly brackets. A block scope is simply for that small statement, I can put this better in an example.
if(3 === 3) <-----this is a blocked scope as that statement is only valid within that specific conditional.

3. How would you explain the idea of "inheritance" in object oriented programming?
I would explain it like so:
All cars essentially the same to its core. 4 wheels, an engine, doors, and a steering wheel. However what makes them different are different attributes, how the engine behaves, or how a certain part of the car operates. In a sense the basic Car class is being extended to every other car out there. Taking the same basic attributes the car has, but then giving the other cars their own behaviors or attributes to make it unique or different.

A class inheritance is a class taking another classes attributes and either changing them or adding more to that specific class in order to create the program needed.
